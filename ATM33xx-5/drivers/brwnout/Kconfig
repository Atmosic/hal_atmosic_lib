            Controls the VBAT brownout threshold for the non-lithium ion battery type.
            For battery level <= 1.8V,
                VBAT threshold = 0.9 + 0.025X, where 0 <= X <= 31
            For battery level > 1.8V,
                VBAT threshold = 1.4 + 0.05X, where
                    0 <= X <= 31, for non-rechargeable battery type
                    0 <= X <= 17, for rechargeable battery type
            The battery level is specified through OTP and is equal to BATT_LEVEL_GT_1P8V by default. It can be overwritten through CONFIG_BATT_LEVEL. Refer to the PMU configuration for additional details.

            The thread priority should be lower (higher number) than the application thread priority.
